こんにちは！Thank you for visiting this wiki, where you'll find recommendations on the best food spots and hot springs all around Japan. I hope that this will be useful resource when planning for your upcoming trips to the land of the rising sun. 

Do note that all recommendations are based on personal experiences at the time, therefore your experience may vary. If there are any changes to a place when you're there (i.e a restaurant had closed down), do [let me know](mailto:shokuonsen@gmail.com) and I'll update the relevant section. If you have good places to share, feel free to contribute as well!
