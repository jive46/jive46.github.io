# About SHOKUONSEN

My name is Ian and I come from Singapore. Having been to Japan a number of times, people around me often ask me for my recommendations of the best places to visit in Japan. The problem is, there is just **too many**! Therefore, I had decided to put all my favourite places into one place, with the aim of becoming a one-stop resource for travellers to Japan.
